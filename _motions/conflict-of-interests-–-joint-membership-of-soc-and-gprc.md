## Synopsis

Standing Orders Committee (SOC) and Green Party Regional Committee (GPRC) are two of the most powerful and demanding bodies on the Party. For anyone to be members of both bodies risks conflicts of interests and an inappropriate concentration of power and influence.

## Motion

<p class="alert d-inline-block alert-primary"><strong>SOC Note: </strong> This motion will require a 2/3 majority to pass.</p>

This motion proposes to change the following phrase from Section 10 CONFERENCES Clause iv) of the Constitution of the Green Party of England and Wales from:

“(not more than two of whom shall be members of the Regional Council).”

to:

“(none of whom shall be members of the Regional Council).”

So Section 10. CONFERENCES Clause iv) now reads:

“iv) The SOC shall consist of not more than five members elected by Annual Conference (none of whom shall be members of the Regional Council).”

<p class="alert d-inline-block alert-primary"><strong>SOC Note: </strong> In accordance with the Constitution s21(iii): "No amendment to the Constitution shall be retrospective in nature/effect", the passing of this motion will not affect any member currently in the position of being a properly elected member of both bodies until the next election for one or the other takes place.</p>
