## **Synopsis**

This is a holding motion to ratify the Green Party General Election Manifesto 2024, Long Version with Cover, as posted at  *[ https://greenparty.org.uk/app/uploads/2024/06/Green-Party-2024-General-Election-Manifesto-Long-version-with-cover.pdf](https://greenparty.org.uk/app/uploads/2024/06/Green-Party-2024-General-Election-Manifesto-Long-version-with-cover.pdf)*.

## **Background**

The objective of this motion is, in the absence of any other motion from GPRC or PDC to ratify the manifesto, to introduce the Manifesto to Conference to allow members to vote on it as policy, with or without any amendments that may be brought. Given the agenda deadlines, Policy Working Groups with an interest in clarifying elements of the Manifesto cannot be sure before the deadline that any such motion will be brought by the relevant bodies.

## **Motion**

Conference is asked to ratify the Green Party General Election Manifesto 2024, Long Version with Cover, as posted at  *[ https://greenparty.org.uk/app/uploads/2024/06/Green-Party-2024-General-Election-Manifesto-Long-version-with-cover.pdf](https://greenparty.org.uk/app/uploads/2024/06/Green-Party-2024-General-Election-Manifesto-Long-version-with-cover.pdf)* as a policy statement.
