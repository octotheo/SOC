**Embracing consensus-based governance:**\
\
**1.** **Principles of Consensus:** The Green Party acknowledges that consensus-based decision-making aligns with our core values of participatory democracy, social justice, and environmental sustainability. Embracing consensus ensures that decisions are made collectively, considering the perspectives and input of all members.\
\
**2.** **Inclusivity and Participation:** Consensus-based governance empowers all members to contribute to the decision-making process, creating a more inclusive and participatory environment within the party.\
\
**Implement consensus-building processes:**\
\
**The Green Party Philosophical Basis encourages:**\
\
**1. Facilitation of Dialogue:**  implementing use of techniques and processes that encourage open dialogue, active listening, and respectful communication among members during decision-making discussions.\
\
**2. Conflict Resolution Mechanisms:** developing mechanisms for conflict resolution and mediation to address disagreements and ensure that consensus is reached through constructive dialogue and negotiation.\
\
**3. Consensus Building Tools:** Provision of training and resources on consensus-building tools and techniques to equip members with the skills necessary to engage in collaborative decision-making processes effectively.\
\
**Rationale:** As outlined in the Green Party Manifesto 2024, we are dedicated to defending human rights, democracy, and justice. Implementing consensus-based governance internally aligns with our commitment to promoting a culture of collaboration, inclusivity, and mutual respect among members. This internal governance model reflects the democratic principles we advocate for in wider society.\

\
**Enhance Member Engagement:** Encourage active participation from all members, fostering a sense of ownership in the party's direction and decision-making processes.

**Strengthen Internal Democracy:** Ensure that decisions are made collectively and reflect the diverse perspectives and interests of party members, promoting unity and cooperation.
