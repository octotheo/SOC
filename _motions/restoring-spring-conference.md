## Synopsis

D18, autumn 2023 led to the cancellation of spring conference.  This has led to unintended consequences that have been stressful for members developing policy, have added to the work of PDC with no additional resources and required constitutional work-arounds to allow new major policy to continue to be developed.

## Motion

<p class="alert d-inline-block alert-primary"><strong>SOC Note: </strong> This motion will require a 2/3 majority to pass.</p>

In light of the unintended consequences, particularly facilitating the updating of the Policy for a Sustainable Society, much of which is very out of date, conference resolves to reinstate spring conference to enable the policy process to run smoothly.

Specifically, conference reinstates the constitution as follows:

Section 10.i of the Green Party constitution: delete the wording, “and may hold an additional Conference each spring, only when it is financially prudent to do so…” with “and will usually hold an additional conference each spring”.
