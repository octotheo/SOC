```

1.2 Breaches of Section 3 (Expectations) of this Members’ Code of Conduct (MCC) may be considered grounds for disciplinary action following a complaint which will be handled using the Party’s agreed disputes and complaints process (see Section 5) or may be grounds to make use of one of the other suitable party procedures which do not require a formal disciplinary complaint to be registered.

Such other procedures include (but are not necessarily limited to): the Speaking Out policy, Safeguarding policy, a no-confidence, recall, or deselection procedure, or the Regional Council’s powers to regulate party membership. These procedures are defined in other organisational documents and may have other triggers not set out in this Code.

**2.0 Founding Principles**

These principles are drawn from the Party's Philosophical Basis (PB) and Core Values (CV) and underpin the expectations set out in Section 3.

*We affirm that:*

2.1 An individual has the right to freedom of thought and self-expression, so far as this does not undermine our philosophical basis or core values. (PB401)


<div class="amendment amendment-tbd">
<div class="d-flex justify-content-between align-items-start">
<h3 id="amendment-8">Amendment #8</h3>
</div>
    
Delete the words, ‘thought and’
  
</div>          
            


<div class="amendment amendment-tbd">
<div class="d-flex justify-content-between align-items-start">
<h3 id="amendment-9">Amendment #9</h3>
</div>
    
Remove section 2.1 and replace it with the following text from the current Code of Conduct:

Members’ right to freedom of thought, conscience and belief should be respected (CoC 8.1)
  
</div>          
            

2.2 An individual has the right to freedom of behaviour provided such action does not harm others. (PB403)

2.3 An individual must take responsibility for the consequences of their own actions.

2.4 An individual has a right to non-violent action. (PB442 and PB501)

2.5 Members have a duty to help make the Green party an organisation in which people feel included, are safe, encouraged to contribute and welcomed regardless of background.

2.6 Members who believe they have observed breaches of Section 3 have a duty to report this using the complaints procedure (see Section 5) or another relevant process.


<div class="amendment amendment-tbd">
<div class="d-flex justify-content-between align-items-start">
<h3 id="amendment-10">Amendment #10</h3>
</div>
    
Remove section 2.3 “ An individual must take responsibility for the consequences of their own actions” and change subsequent numbering.
  
</div>

This also to apply in paragraph 3:24
  
</div>          
            

**3.0 Expectations**

**General Conduct**

3.1 We must not unlawfully discriminate against anyone on the basis of a protected characteristic that a person may have.

3.2 We must not bully or harass anyone contrary to *Appendix A* of this Code of Conduct.

3.3 We must not engage in violent conduct against other party members, members of staff, or members of the public.

3.4 We must not lie to other party members or members of staff.

3.5 We must not spread unfounded rumours about other party members or members of staff.


<div class="amendment amendment-tbd">
<div class="d-flex justify-content-between align-items-start">
<h3 id="amendment-13">Amendment #13</h3>
</div>
    
Insert sentence, ‘This includes violence against property as well as persons.
  
</div>          
            


<div class="amendment amendment-tbd">
<div class="d-flex justify-content-between align-items-start">
<h3 id="amendment-14">Amendment #14</h3>
</div>
    
Add the word “maliciously” to 3.5 so it now reads:

3.5 We must not maliciously spread unfounded rumours about other party members or members of staff.
  
</div>          
            

3.6 We must not insult or act disrespectfully towards other party members or members of staff – but it is not a breach of this clause to hold others to account, criticise the conduct of others within reason, or accuse others of wrongdoing (including but not limited to breaches of this Members’ Code of Conduct).

3.7 We must not engage in conduct which brings the Green Party into disrepute or is likely to do so, and when standing for public office we must disclose anything in our history that is likely to do so.

3.8 We must not publicly undermine or contradict the *Green Party’s* *Core Values*.


<div class="amendment amendment-tbd">
<div class="d-flex justify-content-between align-items-start">
<h3 id="amendment-15">Amendment #15</h3>
</div>
    
Add the “Green Party’s Core Values” here for clarity as they are not detailed nor attached to this document

So 3.8 now reads:

3.8 We must not publicly undermine or contradict the Green Party’s Core Values which are:

*1. The Green Party is a party of social and environmental justice, which supports a radical transformation of society for the benefit of all, and for the planet as a whole. We understand that the threats to economic, social and environmental wellbeing are part of the same problem, and recognise that solving one of these crises cannot be achieved without solving the others.*

*2. The success of a society cannot be measured by narrow economic indicators, but should take account of factors affecting the quality of life for all people: personal freedom, social equity, health, happiness, human fulfilment along with biodiversity and ecosystem health and stability. Indicators of societal and ecosystem health should be mindful of the fact that human influence has already caused rapid climate change and significantly damaged biodiversity and ecosystem health.*

*3. Humankind depends on the diversity of the natural world for its existence. We do not believe that other species are expendable.*

*4. The Earth’s physical resources are finite. We threaten our future if we try to live beyond those means, so we must build a sustainable society that guarantees our long-term future.*

*5. Every person, in this and future generations, is entitled to basic material security. 6. Our actions should take account of the well-being of other nations, other species, and future generations. We should not pursue our well-being to the detriment of theirs or assume that interventions by us are always helpful.*

*7. A healthy society is based on voluntary co-operation between empowered individuals in a democratic society, free from discrimination whether based on race, colour, gender, sexual orientation, religion, social origin or any other prejudice.*

*8. We emphasise democratic participation and accountability by ensuring that decisions are taken at the closest practical level to those affected by them.*

*9. We look for non-violent solutions to conflict situations, which take into account the interests of minorities and future generations in order to achieve lasting settlements. 10.Electoral politics is not the only way to achieve change in society, and we will use a variety of methods, including lifestyle changes, and non-violent direct action, to help effect progress, providing those methods do not conflict with our other core principles.*
  
</div>          
            

3.9 We must conduct ourselves in a way that enables the Green Party to be a space that is as safe or safer than society as a whole. Our conduct towards members and staff should be: tolerant, considerate, respectful, and civil.

3.10 We must all take accusations of wrongdoing seriously – and those in positions of responsibility must work to protect victims of discriminatory, oppressive, or abusive behaviour and provide an environment free of such conduct.

**Political Opponents**

3.11 We must not be members of another UK political party, except other ‘sister’ Green Parties based in the UK outside of England and Wales.

3.12 We must not stand for election against a properly selected Green Party candidate or campaign for a person standing against a properly selected Green Party candidate, nor act as their agent.


<div class="amendment amendment-tbd">
<div class="d-flex justify-content-between align-items-start">
<h3 id="amendment-16">Amendment #16</h3>
</div>
    
Remove section 3.10 entirely.
  
</div>          
            


<div class="amendment amendment-tbd">
<div class="d-flex justify-content-between align-items-start">
<h3 id="amendment-17">Amendment #17</h3>
</div>
    
(Part A) At the end of the section titled "General Conduct”, insert the following additional number points and then renumber the document:

3.X Members should always assume other members are acting with the best intent, unless there is clear evidence to the contrary.
  
</div>          
            

**Internal Democracy**

3.13 We must follow and observe all properly authorised organisational policies and procedures, including the Constitution of the Green Party and its subordinate documents.

3.14 We must respect the properly authorised autonomy and democratic decision making of constituent parts of the Green Party.


<div class="amendment amendment-tbd">
<div class="d-flex justify-content-between align-items-start">
<h3 id="amendment-18">Amendment #18</h3>
</div>
    
Remove 3.14 and change subsequent numbering.
  
</div>          
            

3.15 We must not improperly disrupt Green Party meetings or procedures.

3.16 We must not abuse any actual or perceived position of power, influence, responsibility, or trust that we may have over other party members or members of staff.


<div class="amendment amendment-tbd">
<div class="d-flex justify-content-between align-items-start">
<h3 id="amendment-19">Amendment #19</h3>
</div>
    
Replace “abuse” with “take advantage of” in 3.16

<p class="alert d-inline-block alert-primary"><strong>SOC Note: </strong> The remaining text of this amendment was found to be Out of Order for being trivial</p>
  
</div>          
            

3.17 We must not blackmail, coerce, or improperly influence other party members or members of staff in a way which interferes with internal or external democratic decision-making.

3.18 We must respect confidentiality when it has been agreed or imposed using a properly authorised procedure, and any challenges to confidentiality must be made using appropriate channels. Confidentiality does not affect a member’s rights as set out in the party’s Speaking Out (formerly: Whistleblowing) policy.

3.19 We must comply with any disciplinary sanctions or any other judgements made by the Green Party against us or other party members using properly authorised procedures.

**Finance and Regulation**

3.20 We must not spend or commit Green Party funds without having the proper authority to do so.

3.21 We must not approve expenditure of Green Party funds which puts the party or any part of it at risk of insolvency.

3.22 We must meet the legal obligations of the Green Party, including keeping adequate records of our decisions or communications, and we must produce them or make them available in line with any properly authorised procedures.

3.23 We must abide by all relevant and current electoral law(s).

**Using the Complaints System**

3.24 Members have a duty to report any wrongdoing they have witnessed and must do so using the disputes and complaints process (see Section 5) or another suitable and properly authorised procedure (see Clause 1.2).


<div class="amendment amendment-tbd">
<div class="d-flex justify-content-between align-items-start">
<h3 id="amendment-20">Amendment #20</h3>
</div>
    
Remove 3.24 and alter subsequent numbering.
  
</div>          
            

3.25 We must not abuse the disputes and complaints process by submitting complaints contrary to the *UPVAM Guidance*.

<p class="alert d-inline-block alert-primary"><strong>SOC Note: </strong> The acronym ‘UPVAM’ as used here and in motion D15 stands for ‘Unreasonable, Persistent, Vexatious, Abusive or Malicious’.</p>

3.26 We must consider recusing ourselves from decisions where we may have a conflict of interest, as set out in the *guidance on recusal*.


<div class="amendment amendment-tbd">
<div class="d-flex justify-content-between align-items-start">
<h3 id="amendment-21">Amendment #21</h3>
</div>
    
Replace “must consider recusing ourselves” in 3.26 with “must recuse ourselves”.

3.26 should now state:

3.26 We must recuse ourselves from decisions where we may have a conflict of interest, as set out in the guidance on recusal.
  
</div>          
            


<div class="amendment amendment-tbd">
<div class="d-flex justify-content-between align-items-start">
<h3 id="amendment-22">Amendment #22</h3>
</div>
    
Delete words, ‘consider recusing’ and ‘may’

Insert word, ‘recuse’
  
</div>          
            

**Agents of the Party**

3.27 Members in a position of responsibility organising meetings or activities have a duty of care to ensure attendees are not put in harm’s way as a result of negligence.


<div class="amendment amendment-tbd">
<div class="d-flex justify-content-between align-items-start">

<h3 id="amendment-24">Amendment #24</h3>
</div>
    
Insert the words, ‘or for the benefit of the members of their Special Interest Group, if they are on the committee of such a body.’
  
</div>          
            

3.28 When we speak on behalf of the Green Party (including but not limited to: Leadership, Spokespeople, candidates for political office, public office holders, and internal office holders), if we are expressing a view differing from Green Party policy then we must ensure we also state Green Party policy and make clear that our views are not Green Party policy.

3.29 Members who hold internal or public office must follow the Seven Principles of Public Life (known as the Nolan Principles) when acting in an official capacity:

3.29.1 Selflessness – Holders of public office should act solely in terms of the public interest.

3.29.2 Integrity – Holders of public office must avoid placing themselves under any obligation to people or organisations that might try inappropriately to influence them in their work. They should not act or take decisions in order to gain financial or other material benefits for themselves, their family, or their friends. They must declare and resolve any interests and relationships.

3.29.3 Objectivity – Holders of public office must act and take decisions impartially, fairly and on merit, using the best evidence and without discrimination or bias.

3.29.4 Accountability – Holders of public office are accountable to the public for their decisions and actions and must submit themselves to the scrutiny necessary to ensure this.

3.29.5 Openness – Holders of public office should act and take decisions in an open and transparent manner. Information should not be withheld from the public unless there are clear and lawful reasons for so doing.

3.29.6 Honesty – Holders of public office should be truthful.

3.29.7 Leadership – Holders of public office should exhibit these principles in their own behaviour and treat others with respect. They should actively promote and robustly support the principles and challenge poor behaviour wherever it occurs.

**4.0 Oversight**

This document is to be kept under review by a group known as the Code of Conduct Oversight Body, consisting of: the Co-Chairs of Green Party Regional Council (GPRC), the Chair of Disciplinary Committee (DC), the Coordinator of the Alternative Disputes Resolution Committee (ADRC), and the Chair of the Green Party Executive (GPEx), or their deputies or substitutes.


<div class="amendment amendment-tbd">
<div class="d-flex justify-content-between align-items-start">
<h3 id="amendment-25">Amendment #25</h3>
</div>
    
Add “Head of Governance” to the membership of the Code of Conduct Oversight Body.
  
</div>          
            

4.1 Updating – Standing Orders Committee (SOC) may make simple updates or corrections to this Code as to numbering, terminology, names of groups, references to other procedures or documents as they change – and should do so promptly so as to keep this document relevant, up to date, and fit for purpose.

4.2 Revision – The Code of Conduct Oversight Body may propose revisions to this document on which it has reached consensus after consultation with relevant staff. If there is consensus, the changes will take effect immediately without requirement for further ratification. Revisions for which there is a majority in favour but not consensus are to be ratified via inclusion in a report from the oversight body to the next Conference. Subject to a majority Conference vote in favour of the report, any revision shall take immediate effect.


<div class="amendment amendment-tbd">
<div class="d-flex justify-content-between align-items-start">
<h3 id="amendment-26">Amendment #26</h3>
</div>
    
Replace “the changes will take effect immediately without requirement for further ratification” with “the changes will take effect immediately, membership will be informed of the changes immediately and the changes will be ratified at the next conference and membership promptly informed of them”.
  
</div>          
            


<div class="amendment amendment-tbd">
<div class="d-flex justify-content-between align-items-start">
<h3 id="amendment-27">Amendment #27</h3>
</div>
    
Delete the whole sentence beginning ‘If there is consensus…’

Insert in the sentence beginning, ‘Revisions for which…’ the phrase ‘, alongside consensus decisions,’ so that it reads,

‘Revisions for which there is a majority in favour but not consensus, alongside consensus decisions, are to be ratified via inclusion in a report from the oversight body to the next Conference.’
  
</div>          
            

4.3 Appending documents – From time to time a body with the competent authority to do so may produce a supplementary organisational document and propose that it be appended to this Members’ Code of Conduct. The proposal must specify exactly which clauses or parts of clauses are to be appended, which has the effect of making them grounds for disciplinary action. A consensus decision of the oversight body is sufficient to bring the changes into effect, otherwise a change to an appendix for which there is a majority in favour but not a consensus shall be brought to the next Conference for ratification via a report, as set out in the above clause. Appendices may be changed or removed under this provision.


<div class="amendment amendment-tbd">
<div class="d-flex justify-content-between align-items-start">
<h3 id="amendment-28">Amendment #28</h3>
</div>
    
Replace “propose” with “send a formal proposal to the oversight body” in 4.3.
  
</div>          
            


<div class="amendment amendment-tbd">
<div class="d-flex justify-content-between align-items-start">

Replace “A consensus decision of the oversight body is sufficient to bring the changes into effect, otherwise a change to an appendix for which there is a majority in favour but not a consensus shall be brought to the next Conference for ratification via a report, as set out in the above clause”

with “The oversight body will review the proposal, agree which clauses or parts of clauses could legitimately be added to the MCC and bring these to the next Conference for ratification via a report, as set out above. If approved by a majority at conference, members will be promptly informed of the additions”.

4.3 now reads:

4.3 Appending documents – From time to time a body with the competent authority to do so may produce a supplementary organisational document and send a formal proposal to the oversight body that it be appended to this Members’ Code of Conduct. The proposal must specify exactly which clauses or parts of clauses are to be appended, which has the effect of making them grounds for disciplinary action.The oversight body will review the proposal, agree which clauses or parts of clauses could legitimately be added to the MCC and bring these to the next Conference for ratification via a report, as set out above.

<div class="amendment amendment-tbd">
<div class="d-flex justify-content-between align-items-start">
<h3 id="amendment-30">Amendment #30</h3>
</div>
    
Delete the words from, ‘A consensus decision…’ to the words. ‘into effect, otherwise’

[](<>)Insert the words, ‘Both consensus decisions about changes and’

So that new text reads:

‘Both consensus decisions about changes and a change to an appendix for which there is a majority in favour but not a consensus shall be brought to the next Conference for ratification via a report, as set out in the above clause.’
  
</div>          
            

4.4 No appended document may nullify or be in conflict with any clause in this Members’ Code of Conduct, the GPEW Constitution, or the Standing Orders for Party Discipline. A document proposed to be appended to this Code under Clause 4.3 also may not be in conflict with or nullify a document that is already appended to it.


<div class="amendment amendment-tbd">
<div class="d-flex justify-content-between align-items-start">
<h3 id="amendment-31">Amendment #31</h3>
</div>
    
Remove section “A document proposed to be appended to this Code under Clause 4.3 also may not be in conflict with or nullify a document that is already appended to it” of 4.4

Section 4.4 now reads:

4.4 No appended document may nullify or be in conflict with any clause in this Members’ Code of Conduct, the GPEW Constitution, or the Standing Orders for Party Discipline.

Include new descriptive paragraph: ‘The Guides already include self-contradictory material, and as they are aids for those making decisions who may not have experienced a particular kind of discrimination, they are by their very nature subjective descriptions.’
  
</div>

Political Opponents\
Internal Democracy\
Finance and Regulation\

Agents of the Party

4 Oversight

6 Appended Documents

**1.0 Introduction**

1.1 The purpose of this document is to set out standards of behaviour and conduct for all Green Party members and volunteers. As a member of or volunteer for the Green Party, we agree to meet these expectations and act accordingly when representing the Green Party.

1.2 Breaches of Section 3 (Expectations) of this Members’ Code of Conduct (MCC) may be considered grounds for disciplinary action following a complaint which will be handled using the Party’s agreed disputes and complaints process (see Section 5) or may be grounds to make use of one of the other suitable party procedures which do not require a formal disciplinary complaint to be registered.

Such other procedures include (but are not necessarily limited to): the Speaking Out policy, Safeguarding policy, a no-confidence, recall, or deselection procedure, or the Regional Council’s powers to regulate party membership. These procedures are defined in other organisational documents and may have other triggers not set out in this Code.

1.3 This Members’ Code of Conduct is effective from the moment of its adoption.\
Any breaches of the Members’ Code of Conduct shall be assessed against the version of the Code of Conduct effective at the time of conduct in question, except where a pattern of behaviour takes place over a period of time in which multiple versions of the Code were in effect – in which case the latest version at the time of the submission of the complaint will normally be considered.

**2.0 Founding Principles**

These principles are drawn from the Party's Philosophical Basis (PB) and Core Values (CV) and underpin the expectations set out in Section 3.

*We affirm that:*

2.1 An individual has the right to freedom of thought and self-expression, so far as this does not undermine our philosophical basis or core values. (PB401)

2.2 An individual has the right to freedom of behaviour provided such action does not harm others. (PB403)

2.3 An individual must take responsibility for the consequences of their own actions.

2.4 An individual has a right to non-violent action. (PB442 and PB501)

2.5 Members have a duty to help make the Green party an organisation in which people feel included, are safe, encouraged to contribute and welcomed regardless of background.

2.6 Members who believe they have observed breaches of Section 3 have a duty to report this using the complaints procedure (see Section 5) or another relevant process.

**3.0 Expectations**

**General Conduct**

3.1 Members/volunteers must not unlawfully discriminate against anyone on the basis of a protected characteristic that a person may have.

3.2 Members/volunteers must not bully or harass anyone contrary to *Appendix A* of this Code of Conduct.

3.3 Members/volunteers must not engage in violent conduct against other party members, members of staff, or members of the public.

3.4 Members/volunteers must not lie to other party members or members of staff.

3.5 Members/volunteers must not spread unfounded rumours about other party members or members of staff.

3.6 Members/volunteers must not insult or act disrespectfully towards other party members or members of staff – but it is not a breach of this clause to hold others to account, criticise the conduct of others within reason, or accuse others of wrongdoing (including but not limited to breaches of this Members’ Code of Conduct).

3.7 Members/volunteers must not engage in conduct which brings the Green Party into disrepute or is likely to do so, and when standing for public office they must disclose anything in their history that is likely to do so.

3.8 Members/volunteers must not publicly undermine or contradict the *Green Party’s* *Core Values*.

3.9 Members/volunteers must conduct themselves in a way that enables the Green Party to be a space that is as safe or safer than society as a whole. Conduct towards members and staff should be: tolerant, considerate, respectful, and civil.

3.10 Members must all take accusations of wrongdoing seriously – and those in positions of responsibility must work to protect victims of discriminatory, oppressive, or abusive behaviour and provide an environment free of such conduct.

**Political Opponents**

3.11 Members must not be members of another UK political party, except other ‘sister’ Green Parties based in the UK outside of England and Wales.

3.12 Members must not stand for election against a properly selected Green Party candidate or campaign for a person standing against a properly selected Green Party candidate, nor act as their agent.

**Internal Democracy**

3.13 Members/volunteers must follow and observe all properly authorised organisational policies and procedures, including the Constitution of the Green Party and its subordinate documents.

3.14 Members/volunteers must respect the properly authorised autonomy and democratic decision making of constituent parts of the Green Party.

3.15 Members/volunteers must not improperly disrupt Green Party meetings or procedures.

3.16 Members/volunteers must not abuse any actual or perceived position of power, influence, responsibility, or trust that they may have over other party members or members of staff.

3.17 Members/volunteers must not blackmail, coerce, or improperly influence other party members or members of staff in a way which interferes with internal or external democratic decision-making.

3.18 Members/volunteers must respect confidentiality when it has been agreed or imposed using a properly authorised procedure, and any challenges to confidentiality must be made using appropriate channels. Confidentiality does not affect a member’s rights as set out in the party’s Speaking Out (formerly: Whistleblowing) policy.

3.19 Members must comply with any disciplinary sanctions or any other judgements made by the Green Party against them or other party members using properly authorised procedures.

**Finance and Regulation**

3.20 Members/volunteers must not spend or commit Green Party funds without having the proper authority to do so.

3.21 Members/volunteers must not approve expenditure of Green Party funds which puts the party or any part of it at risk of insolvency.

3.22 Members must meet the legal obligations of the Green Party, including keeping adequate records of decisions or communications, and they must produce them or make them available in line with any properly authorised procedures.

3.23 Members/volunteers must abide by all relevant and current electoral law(s).

**Using the Complaints System**

3.24 Members have a duty to report any wrongdoing they have witnessed and must do so using the disputes and complaints process (see Section 5) or another suitable and properly authorised procedure (see Clause 1.2).

3.25 Members must not abuse the disputes and complaints process by submitting complaints contrary to the *UPVAM Guidance*.

3.26 Members must consider recusing themselves from decisions where they may have a conflict of interest, as set out in the *guidance on recusal*.

**Agents of the Party**

3.27 Members in a position of responsibility organising meetings or activities have a duty of care to ensure attendees are not put in harm’s way as a result of negligence.

3.28 When members speak on behalf of the Green Party (including but not limited to: Leadership, Spokespeople, candidates for political office, public office holders, and internal office holders), if they are expressing a view differing from Green Party policy then they must ensure they also state Green Party policy and make clear that their views are not Green Party policy.

3.29 Members who hold internal or public office must follow the Seven Principles of Public Life (known as the Nolan Principles) when acting in an official capacity:

3.29.1 Selflessness – Holders of public office should act solely in terms of the public interest.

3.29.2 Integrity – Holders of public office must avoid placing themselves under any obligation to people or organisations that might try inappropriately to influence them in their work. They should not act or take decisions in order to gain financial or other material benefits for themselves, their family, or their friends. They must declare and resolve any interests and relationships.

3.29.3 Objectivity – Holders of public office must act and take decisions impartially, fairly and on merit, using the best evidence and without discrimination or bias.

3.29.4 Accountability – Holders of public office are accountable to the public for their decisions and actions and must submit themselves to the scrutiny necessary to ensure this.

3.29.5 Openness – Holders of public office should act and take decisions in an open and transparent manner. Information should not be withheld from the public unless there are clear and lawful reasons for so doing.

3.29.6 Honesty – Holders of public office should be truthful.

3.29.7 Leadership – Holders of public office should exhibit these principles in their own behaviour and treat others with respect. They should actively promote and robustly support the principles and challenge poor behaviour wherever it occurs.

**4.0 Oversight**

This document is to be kept under review by a group known as the Members’ Code of Conduct Oversight Body, consisting of: the Co-Chairs of Green Party Regional Council (GPRC), the Chair of Disciplinary Committee (DC), the Coordinator of the Alternative Disputes Resolution Committee (ADRC), and the Chair of the Green Party Executive (GPEx), or their deputies or substitutes.

4.1 Updating – Standing Orders Committee (SOC) may make simple updates or corrections to this Code as to numbering, terminology, names of groups, references to other procedures or documents as they change – and should do so promptly so as to keep this document relevant, up to date, and fit for purpose.

4.2 Revision – The Members’ Code of Conduct Oversight Body may propose revisions to this document on which it has reached consensus after consultation with relevant staff. If there is consensus, the changes will take effect immediately without requirement for further ratification. Revisions for which there is a majority in favour but not consensus are to be ratified via inclusion in a report from the oversight body to the next Conference. Subject to a majority Conference vote in favour of the report, any revision shall take immediate effect.

4.3 Appending documents – From time to time a body with the competent authority to do so may produce a supplementary organisational document and propose that it be appended to this Members’ Code of Conduct. The proposal must specify exactly which clauses or parts of clauses are to be appended, which has the effect of making them grounds for disciplinary action. A consensus decision of the oversight body is sufficient to bring the changes into effect, otherwise a change to an appendix for which there is a majority in favour but not a consensus shall be brought to the next Conference for ratification via a report, as set out in the above clause. Appendices may be changed or removed under this provision.

4.4 No appended document may nullify or be in conflict with any clause in this Members’ Code of Conduct, the GPEW Constitution, or the Standing Orders for Party Discipline. A document proposed to be appended to this Code under Clause 4.3 also may not be in conflict with or nullify a document that is already appended to it.

**5.0 Complaints Procedure**

The complaints procedure is outlined in the Standing Orders for Party Discipline (SOPD). This is available on the members website alongside supporting documentation and guidance.

The following documents support the disputes and complaints process:
