## M﻿otion

Fraud on Ministry of Defence procurement contracts potentially runs into tens of billions of pounds. There are credible allegations of fraud which have not been subjected to proper investigation by an independent police force. The Green Party supports the call for Police Scotland to investigate these allegations.

Paul Gregory used to run his own accountancy firm, before he was asked by The Treasury ![](https://spaces.greenparty.org.uk/file/file/download?guid=00369f35-bb01-440f-b060-b5363913d8f9 "94BB605F-A010-4EB7-9299-77755829B710.jpeg")to investigate fraud on MOD contracts. He found MOD civil servants “time and time again blatantly lying to cover up fraud“. The system of government in this country is so corrupt that the MOD were not only able to block any action on his report, but to prevent any mention of it in the press. The Military Industrial Complex also put pressure on Gregory’s customers to stop doing business with him, causing his firm to collapse.

In 2008 Transparency International completely accepted Paul Gregory’s story, but refused to do anything about it. At the 2008 TI (UK) AGM, the CEO of Transparency International answered a question from me by saying, essentially ‘ if we take on the MOD, we are the ones who will suffer’.
