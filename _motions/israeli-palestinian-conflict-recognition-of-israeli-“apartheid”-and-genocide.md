## **Synopsis**

The Green Party reaffirms its commitment to human rights and international law concerning the Palestinian people. This motion seeks to establish clear policy positions with our communications reflecting our solidarity with the Palestinian struggle for self-determination and freedom.

## **Motion**

Insert into Policies for a Sustainable Society in the International Section following IP634:

**Recognition of Israeli Apartheid as “Apartheid” :** The Green Party recognises and condemns Israel's policies as apartheid, based on definitions from international law:

* International Convention on Apartheid (1973) and Rome Statute (1998): Israel's practices, including extrajudicial killings, severe movement restrictions, discriminatory laws, and economic exploitation, align with apartheid definitions.
* International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (1965): Israel's racial segregation and discrimination violate this treaty, which Israel ratified in 1979.

  We call for an end to all forms of apartheid and equal rights for all. The term "apartheid" accurately describes the institutionalised regime of systematic oppression and domination by one racial group over another, as identified by international human rights bodies and legal experts.

**Use of "Genocide" Terminology:** The Green Party condemns genocide per the UN Genocide Convention (1948):

* Acts qualifying as genocide: Israeli military operations causing civilian deaths, severe mental and physical harm, life conditions threatening Palestinian survival, and policies disrupting Palestinian family life and heritage.

As of 2024, the systematic violence and restrictions on Palestinians meet the criteria for genocide. This motion ensures our positions comply with international law and our commitment to justice and human rights.
