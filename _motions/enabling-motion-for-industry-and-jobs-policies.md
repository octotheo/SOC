## Synopsis

This motion proposes changes to the PSS to emphasize dismantling polluting industries, specifying accelerated green-industrialization mechanisms, and extending solutions across supply chains and to ecological sources. It aims for a complete fossil fuel phase-out, ensuring just transitions without harming developing countries, and investing in sustainable technical and societal solutions.

## Motion

Conference instructs Policy Development Committee to facilitate policy development, which will be delegated to the Industry and Jobs Policy Working Group, with a view to bringing a Draft Voting Paper and Voting Paper to future conferences that aim to amend current policies that impact on Industry and Jobs.

This will involve making changes to chapters of the PSS, that may include, but not be limited to: Workers Rights & Employment, Science and Technology, Finance & Economy, Climate Emergency, Energy, and Land. The drafting will be delegated to the Industry and Jobs Policy Working Group.

The Industry and Jobs Policy Working Group will seek the opinions and involvement of members of the Party with interest or expertise in these fields, as well as the views of external and other relevant organisations, including those of the Green Parties of Scotland and Northern Ireland, professionals in the field, and all policy working groups. In addition to the objectives outlined in the Synopsis this working group will consider and formulate the following additional amendments:

\- Replace minimize with complete phase out, to accurately outline our ambition and confidence in the

proven technologies that will eventually bring us into carbon negativity.

\- Remove or replace demand reduction as this is putting a burden on the consumer when we want to be putting the burden on the reckless and profit only driven producers. Additionally we must strengthen policy so that our taxes that reduce resource use are guaranteed to not disproportionately disadvantage the poorest in society (globally). As well as acceptance (on a psychological analysis level) of profit driven culture and outline mechanisms to steer us to social and ecological prioritisation.

\- Replace reduce scale with replace methods to complete phase out. Add manufacturing, recycling and waste disposal re-localisation and explore the best mechanisms to achieve this, specifying our commitments to nationalisation, subsidy investments or other solutions.

\- Generally adapt language to be more confident: changing “if properly planned” to “when properly planned”
