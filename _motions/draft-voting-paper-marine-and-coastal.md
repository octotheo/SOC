## Synopsis

At Autumn Conference 2022 the Marine and Coastal Policy Working Group, (M&C PWG) had the enabling motion passed to update, review and rewrite the M&C policy from 2012. The draft voting paper below is intended to be submitted for Autumn Conference 2024 and for the Full Voting Paper to be ready before Autumn Conference 2026.

Our aim is to continue to explore in depth the issues affecting marine and coastal areas, to keep up to date with the many changes occurring and to create principles and background ideas for policy statements. The current policy from 2012 with revision in 2019 is relevant in some areas but also out of date. We wish to have the depth and range needed for the future beyond 2030. We have consulted with coastal councillors, those with expertise in Fisheries, Food, Marine Protected Areas, legislation including rights of nature, marine pollution, and coastal challenges from climate change impacts.

In the current draft we have a new section that deals with biodiversity, establishing a blue carbon strategy, and implementation of the UN COP Biodiversity targets and protecting at least 30% of UK waters and the 30% of the high seas beyond any national jurisdiction. There are also updates on marine pollution and dredging and a new part of the recreational section on leisure boating.
