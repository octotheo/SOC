Edward Milford (Publications Coordinator, GPEx)

Publication of Green World is currently suspended. Clause 17 of the constitution requires Green World to be published at least four times a year, and to be financed by the Party Executive. However, given the large legal costs that have had to be funded over the last two years, the previous GPEx (September 2022-2023) removed all funding from Green World. This had stood at around Â£20k per year, and the cut was one of a number of economy measures made to help meet our legal fees.

When I joined GPEx in September 2023 all activity on Green World had ceased as, without funding, it cannot function. This has, in my view, significantly impaired both our internal communications and debate amongst members and weakened our visibility amongst the wider public.

Given the financial constraints on the Party, it has not yet been possible to reverse the decision of the previous GPEx. A proposal to restore funding to Green World will be put forward for consideration as part of the process to prepare a budget for 2025.
