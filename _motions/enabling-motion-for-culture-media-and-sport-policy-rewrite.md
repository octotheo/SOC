## Synopsis

This policy hasn't been updated in over a decade and needs to account for major changes in cultural, media and sports contexts. The Culture, Media and Sport Policy Working Group (CMS PWG) has begun drafting major revisions to the policy chapter. Additional time is needed to complete consultations and rewriting.

## Motion

Conference believes that a rewrite is required to account for developments, including: social media and digital rights, gambling, the Leveson Inquiry, sports equality and access, and Brexit's impact on culture and media, to name a few.

\
Conference therefore resolves that the Policy Development Committee instruct the Culture Media and Sport Policy Working Group to rewrite and update this policy chapter, bringing a draft voting paper to conference no later than Autumn 2026.
