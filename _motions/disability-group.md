As a newly elected group, we had our first meeting on Zoom in August 2024.



At the meeting we introduced ourselves to each other, and discussed ways forward for the group. The meeting was held in the spirit of collaboration and the atmosphere was positive and forward-thinking. The second meeting took place in October 2024, and the next meeting is planned for the 26th of November, 2024. Minutes are available on request.



I was very pleased to be able to introduce the new Disability Policy on stage at GPEW Conference, and for it to be voted on and accepted as our new Green Party Disability Policy. Our outward facing policy is now fit for purpose. There are four policy issues which affect disabled people which have yet to be settled on. They are:



1. Abortion - when it is known that the unborn child is disabled after 24 weeks and up to the day before the due date, abortion is legal, which is different from unborn children without an identified disability.



2. Euthanasia - many disabled people have expressed concern that the upcoming House of Commons vote will lead to abuse of disabled people and remove their right to life. In timing, it is likely that this vote will coincide with cuts to disability living allowances. It is of concern that euthanasia and affordability of disabled people’s rights to a life worth living may be linked in the decision making process.



3. The right to a family life – in particular the rights of the parent needs to be balanced with the rights of the child.



4. Prison – where should disabled people who have been convicted of a crime be housed, and which restorative practices would improve post prison outcomes?



All of the above issues will be complex to achieve a consensus policy for, and this will need to be discussed in collaboration with other Policy Working Groups.



There were examples at GPEW Conference and Wales Conference of discriminatory procedures for disabled people. It is important that there is an open and constructive discussion about how conferences are organised, and a review of procedure. As a example, calls to extend plenary take no account of people who require set breaks in order to take medication, eat, drink, have the required comfort breaks and so that people are not upset by unnecessary changes in timetabled routines. We intend to approach these issues with a constructive and collaboration spirit of shared values and understanding.



One concern is that some disability email addresses need to be allocated to active disability committee members. The Tech Team have identified several disability email addresses, and are prepared to reallocate the addresses to present committee members. The correct permissions need to be out in place before the Tech Team are able to do this.



In Wales the Senedd Election will take place on Thursday the 7th of May, 2026 and will be the next major campaign. In preparation for this I have been in talks with the Learning Disability Cross Party Group, where we are discussing how to engage learning disabled people in politics. 



I am working with Kat Watkins, Disability Wales, in order to develop a Charter of Rights for Disabled People, whereby positive steps are put in place to being a candidate for the Senedd more accessible. Both projects are set to be in place in good time for the Senedd Election. Further discussion needs to be heard in order to ensure that disabled people who wish to stand as Green Party candidates in Wales receive reasonable adjustments. 22% of the population of Wales are disabled, and it is important that the Green Party appropriately represents the welsh population.



Our bank account holds a small reserve. If we wish to amplify the voices of disabled people, then there are insufficient funds presently available to fully support our disabled members. As a part of the Green Party’s ambition to bring real hope, and real change to the nation, we must address internal party concerns that have been raised. Our new Disability Policy sets high standards for the rights of disabled people in society. It is recommended that we make progress to improve the rights of disabled people with our party structures.
