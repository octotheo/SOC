## M﻿otion

**The cruel, ineffective badger cull must end immediately to prevent further suffering and local extinctions of badgers, and to accelerate the elimination of bovine TB (bTB) in cattle.**

**Labour’s 2024 manifesto stated: “*… we will work with farmers and scientists on measures to eradicate bovine TB, protecting livelihoods, so that we can end the ineffective badger cull*.” On June 29th this was modified: a Labour government would continue to allow pre-existing cull licences, under which the Badger Trust estimates around 100,000 badgers could be killed.**

**Shockingly, on August 30th the government backtracked further: culling would be “phased out” by 2029.**

The Green Party of England and Wales (GPEW) notes that**:**

* Torgerson *et al.* (2024, Scientific Reports – *Nature*) decisively broke the link between badgers and bTB.
* The cull policy is "mindless", according to Lord Krebs, architect of the culling trials.
* The RSPCA and Wildlife Trusts oppose the cull.

Conference calls **for a cattle-based bTB eradication strategy because:**

* The “skin test” used to identify infected cattle gives false negatives; diseased cattle remain in herds.
* Dairy-farm biosecurity is compromised by intensive systems; close proximity of cattle faeces, food and water increases spread of disease.
* A bTB cattle vaccination is available but renders further testing for the disease impossible because vaccinated cattle are indistinguishable from infected cattle: further work is needed.

Conference therefore demands **an immediate end to the cull and for eradication efforts to focus on cattle-related measures, acknowledging evidence that badgers are not to blame for the spread of bTB.**
