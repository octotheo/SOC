## M﻿otion

The Government’s decisions on whether to permit expansion of Gatwick and Luton Airports is imminent. For Gatwick, the examination for the Development Consent Order (DCO) closed on 27th August and recommendation to the Secretary of State for Transport is due by 27th November. Luton’s decision was due on 10th August and has now been delayed until 10th October.

On 19th August the Secretary of State for Transport, Louise Haigh, approved expansion of London City Airport without consulting parliament, prioritising economic growth over climate and other impacts.

Conference calls on our 6 Green parliamentarians and the Green Party Executive to call on the Secretary of State for Transport to review the UK aviation strategy (Jet Zero) to ensure that it aligns with Paris climate commitments, to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees C, before recommending decisions on these matters to be debated by Parliament.
