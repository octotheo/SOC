Cade Hatton (Co-Chair) 

We started the year a little chaotically; we struggled to fill all our posts at election and had to reopen nominations twice. I was elected solo co-chair and a priority was made to find people to fill our empty posts. Thankfully, during the year we were able to co-opt excellent activists to our committee to fill our vacant posts, including my co-chair, Dems. 

February was LGBT+ History Month and we produced some content during this time. Shortly after, the Cass Review was released in full to the public and we shared a statement opposing it, as we believe it is not in line with the Green Party’s core values (or our policies). Unfortunately, our Twitter account was then deactivated by Twitter, which set our social media plans back somewhat. We now have a new account, and have been sharing on Instagram and Facebook as well.

We’ve had ongoing donations and our fundraisers have been, on the whole, successful. 

We have supported various local parties in providing materials for their local prides, as well as attending various events as the LGBTIQA+ Greens, with committee attendance. We have had various meetings across the year, including policy development meetings and social events. We plan to hold our AGM shortly after the party’s AGM, where we will hold our hustings for the new committee, amongst other things.

Going forwards, the current committee plans to continue work on policy development and supporting our membership, while also organising lines of communication with our new MPs.

This is my last year on the committee, after two years as co-chair. I’ve thoroughly enjoyed my role in the LGBTIQA+ Greens, and wish to thank every committee member I’ve served alongside over the last three years.
