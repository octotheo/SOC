GPTU Members at Autumn Conference 2024

The Green Party Trade Union Group is the group for trade unionists, allies and all supporters of the labour movement in the Green Party. We continued to grow in 2024 and now have 897 members, up from 597 at the start of this year, and 1,137 on our mailing list.

Manifesto input

Most of our work earlier this year went into shaping the workers rights section of the manifesto, making it our strongest ever. This included repealing all anti-union laws since 1979; full and equal rights for 'gig economy' workers; a four day, 32-hour working week; and a £15 minimum wage for all.

Along with Matthew Hull, Trade Union Liaison Officer (TULO), we worked closely with staff and External Comms to make sure key policies were included and our pitch was as ambitious as possible. We produced a *[candidate briefing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P5x5328GnGZZeEzvGYug3GuEyb1Dt-60/view?link_id=3&can_id=c9add24f6ace34094038144d48baa4e0&source=email-tomorrow-greens-for-workers&email_referrer=email_2370483&email_subject=candidate-briefing-making-work-fair&pli=1)* and ran an online Greens for Workers Election Rally featuring parliamentary candidates Ria Patel. Once again, a big thank you to everyone who helped improve Green Party policy over recent years - there was great recognition of that from:

This gives us a strong basis to hold Labour to account on its New Deal for Working People, and we are now working with MPs to scrutinise the Employment Rights Bill just introduced to Parliament.

Council cuts and trade unions

At Autumn Conference we held a meeting on the local government funding crisis, featuring Heather Mack (Deputy Leader, Bristol City Council) and Pete Kennedy (Deputy Leader, Stroud District Council). We discussed the ways that working with trade unions could help Green Councillors defend against cuts - particularly urgent as Unite and UNISON council workers are on the verge of national strike action. 

We’ve since had a members meeting on the subject and are in touch with the Association of Green Councillors to produce a joint briefing for Councillors - including practical support for engaging with trade unions locally.

Trade Union Liaison Officers (TULOs)

A growing number of Trade Union Liaison Officers are in place in regional and local parties in the Green Party, as well as our national TULO. Regional TULOs are now listed on our website, we have a job description for the role and we are developing a toolkit for what TULOs can do in their area. If your region doesn’t have one, we’d encourage you to ask your regional party to open one for election or co-option.

Regional TULOs:\
North East - Kevin Lynch\
South East - Steve Williams\
Wales - Ken Barker\
East Midlands - Sue Castillon

Leadership engagement

Alongside Matthew Hull as TULO we have worked with the leadership to increase engagement with TUs nationally. A number of TU leaders were contacted and a meeting with TUC General Secretary Paul Nowak took place before the election. 

Councillor network

Another initiative is the network for Green councillors which was first established last year. This remains a dedicated whatsapp group, where Councillors can share best practice and successes, and ask questions. Contact *[info@gptu.greenparty.org.uk](mailto:info@gptu.greenparty.org.uk)* to join!

Organizing for Power course 

A group of eight GPTU members took part in the global Organizing for Power Core Fundamentals six-week online course in May. It was the final one that took place before lead trainer and legendary trade union organizer and writer, Jane McAlevey, sadly passed away

It’s an amazing course with lessons for all kinds of organising environments. The relentless focus is on building hard power and the super-majorities needed to win; on the difference between self-selecting (people like us who have views in common) and structured (workplace, community, street-by-street) organizing; and how to use organic leaders and 1-1 conversations to gradually build up mass support in your setting. 

Union networks

We began work last year to build networks for specific trade unions within the Green Party. We surveyed GPTU members to improve the data we hold on their membership – Unite is the most represented, followed by NEU and then Unison. A separate email list now exists for Unite members and we aim for this to become a self-organising network for sharing info and support.

The Committee would also like to see trade union membership as one of the optional questions put to new members on their joining journey. This would not only collect important data to help GPTU organise, but show new members that trade union relations are important to the Green Party and its vision of a just and democratic society.

Policy Working Groups

The Workers’ Rights & Employment and Industry & Jobs PWGs are now reformed and operating jointly after a first well-attended meeting at Autumn Conference. A review of the current chapters is ongoing. Anyone who wants to get involved should email *[rob_magowan12@live.co.uk](mailto:rob_magowan12@live.co.uk)*. 

AGM

Our AGM will be on Monday 2nd December, 7pm.

The full GPTU Committee is up for election, and nominations open on Monday 4th November. If you have any questions, email *[info@gptu.greenparty.org.uk](mailto:info@gptu.greenparty.org.uk)*.
