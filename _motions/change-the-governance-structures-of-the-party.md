Insert new clauses 6(vi) to 6(ix) and renumber:

vi) In order to preserve the regional spread of the council, in determining the results of annual ballot to elect ordinary members of the council the following requirement will be applied. At the point of the calculating the results of the election each year, the results shall, subject to the caveats outlined in section viii, provide for there to be amongst the membership of the ordinary members of the council:

a. At least 1 member of Wales Green Party\
b. At least 1 member of each English Regional Party

vii) If at the close of nominations set out in Section 16 Internal Elections and Annual Ballot, part 7 there are insufficient nominations submitted for election to the Council in order that the election can satisfy the requirements set out in part 4 above, then nominations will be re-opened and the requirements to satisfy the constitution published to all members. This re-opened nomination period shall close at noon 5 weekdays prior to the opening of voting.

viii) If following the extended nomination process detailed in section vii above, there are insufficient candidates on the ballot to satisfy the requirements set out in section vi above then the election shall proceed to elect the full number of ordinary members as required and will waive the requirements in section vi for this ballot for that particular region, or Wales, as applicable. There will be a significant communication campaign from the council over the subsequent year within the region(s) concerned, or Wales, regarding the need for candidates to put themselves forward.

ix) If the result of the annual ballot, subject to the caveats outlined in section viii, would produce a Council which does not meet these requirements, then the STV portion of the election will be re-run with 1 less seat available, and the remaining seat will be elected to through an instant runoff election from the geographically eligible candidates in the annual ballot. This process will be repeated for each unrepresented geographic area outlined above.

x) If a member of the council moves to a region of England where they had not been resident at the time of their election, or into Wales, they will continue to be a member of the council. At the next annual election, their current location of membership at time of nomination will be used to determine whether requirements under vi have been met.

Amendments to ensure portfolios are adequately covered by those elected in GPEx election.

In Part Two: Executive,

iii) Add the word “modified”  between ‘seven-seat’ and ‘single transferable vote’

Add new

iv) As part of their nomination, those seeking election as ordinary members must list up to three areas of responsibility they consider they are qualified to take on and would be willing to take on from among the formal set of responsibilities in use by GPEx in operation at the time nominations open. If, when nominations close, no candidates list any particular one of the formal set of responsibilities, or it would be impossible to fulfil the requirements of section vi, nominations will be re-opened for a week for candidates who include that/those particular responsibility(ies) among the three they list.

Add new

v) If following the extended nomination process detailed in section iv above, there are insufficient candidates on the ballot to fill all the formal set of responsibilities set out in section iv above then the election shall proceed to elect the full number of ordinary members as required and will waive any requirements in section vi that cannot be fulfilled.

Add new

vi) If the result of the annual ballot would produce an Executive which cannot meet the requirement for it to be possible for each responsibility to be covered by someone that listed that responsibility, then the STV portion of the election will be re-run with one less seat available, and the remaining seat will be elected to through an instant runoff election from the candidates in the annual ballot who did list that responsibility. This process will be repeated for each listed responsibility that would otherwise be un-covered, in the sequence of the list provided by GPEx at the time of nominations opening.

Renumber current iv as vii and add at end “From time-to-time individual responsibilities may be re-allocated, even if it means that responsibilities are allocated to an ordinary member who did not list a particular responsibility when seeking election, or the formal set of responsibilities be changed (except that the formal set of responsibilities will always include at least one equalities and diversity officer covering all aspects of equality and diversity other than those allocated to another member of the executive, an international officer, and a Trades Union Liaison Officer).”\

If any such Regional Councillor either leaves the Council or is elected to the Council in their own right, the Region which elected them as a Regional Councillor shall not replace them.

The Council shall consist of 32 ordinary members. Once established, each council member’s term will be for three years and a proportion of members will ordinarily be elected every year, using a national single transferable vote (STV) process for 4 of the 12 national members each year and regional annual elections with one regional and Wales representative elected per year for two successive years, with a fallow third year. Any member who has been a member for over two years will be eligible to stand

This shall also apply to the Leader and Deputy leader roles, which shall be elected in the same year as the Chair and Treasurer per section 7 above. The seven ordinary members shall be elected first for a term of only one year, and at any subsequent Annual Ballot in an odd numbered year shall be elected to an ordinary term of two years.

iii) Elections for the GPEx Chair, Treasurer and Specialist member posts shall be by a ballot of all members of the party with voting included within the Annual Ballot. The Chair and Treasurer shall be elected in one year in individual ballots by instant run off, at the same time as the Leader(s) plus Deputy Leader(s).
