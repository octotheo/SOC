Since the election of the current Feminist Greens committee in January 2024, we’ve had a busy first year. We adopted our constitution at our AGM in January and sought affiliation with the Green Party, which was approved.

The committee elected was: Rachel Collinson – Co-Chair, Mina Cousins – Co-Chair, Alina Baczynska – Treasurer, Laura Eccott - Safeguarding Officer, Cade Hatton – Secretary, Marz King - Liberation Officer, Bekah Roebuck - Membership Secretary, Elise Benjamin - Non-Portfolio Officer, Natalia Kubica - Non-Portfolio Officer

We would like to offer special mentions to:

* Elise Benjamin who founded Women By Name, the original group for women in the Green Party
* Laura Eccott and Marz King who have been elected to the Green Party Regional Council.

Following our affiliation, we dived right into the Local and General Elections. Thanks to the hard work of outgoing Co-chair Mina Cousins, we promoted action days in Plymouth, Bristol, Oxford, Birkenhead, Brighton, and various parts of London. We also put out links to crowdfunders and phonebanking sessions for feminist candidates. We are proud to have contributed to the Party’s record-breaking electoral success and especially in getting so many Feminist Greens elected for the first time.

 As a committee, we organised a number of events. These included:

* A panel discussion on “Policing: Who do they protect?” in January
* A disturbing yet cathartic session where we discussed misogyny we have experienced, to contribute to the Party’s guidance on identifying Misogyny
* Joining LGBTIQA+ Greens to celebrate Lesbian Visibility Week
* Our first in-person meeting at Conference where we discussed what policies a Feminist Green government would enact and what our focus points should be for the future.

In March, we were approached by the Green Party Regional Council to work on the Party’s guidance for identifying misogyny, sexism, and chauvinism. We submitted our definition in June 2024 and have since received legal opinion on it. Our next step is to incorporate this feedback and resubmit.

Following a tiring election and Conference, we’ve had some vacancies and have since co-opted:

Aquila S. Hope for Co-Chair

Adi Daly-Gourdialsing for Liberation Officer

…with a number of applications pending for other roles still vacant (Secretary, Membership Secretary, and Safeguarding Officer) which we will confirm in due course.

 At Conference, Natalia Kubica proposed an Emergency Motion of Solidarity with Women in Afghanistan. We are delighted to say that the motion passed unanimously.

 From here, we plan to:

* Agree our future focus points
* Finalise a Progressive Green Healthcare Charter
* Contribute to the definition of Intersectionality for the Green Party’s Framework for Ethics and Conduct
* Put together a strategy for attracting more feminists to the Green Party and make more members aware of our existence.

 We would like to thank everybody who has contacted us with offers of support and encouragement. We look forward to furthering truly intersectional feminist policies and candidates for election within and outside the Party.
