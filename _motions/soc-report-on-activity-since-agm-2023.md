The membership of SOC changed slightly after Autumn Conference 2024. Tim Kiely completed his fifth term on the committee and could not stand again, the committee is grateful for his service. Martha James was elected in his place.



Standing Orders Committee is required to submit a second report to the AGM to be included on the First Agenda reporting on:



1. any changes that SOC have adopted to their own Standing Orders;

2. progress on Organisational Statements;

3. rulings requested and made since the previous SOC report (noting that it is acceptable to cross-reference to SOC reports made to Conferences held since the last AGM without repeating all the content). These are included as Appendix 1 to this Agenda.

4. any other matters or recommendations that do not affect the running of the party’s Conference.

Changes to SOC standing Orders



SOC has proposed no changes to the Standing Orders for SOC



Progress against RoOS



In relation to tasks placed on SOC in relation to additions to the Record of Organisational Statements (RoOS) we can report



Arising from Autumn Conference 2023:

* To update the Constitution in accordance with motions D13, D16 (as amended by amendment 2), D18 and D20 (as amended by amendment 1) to Autumn Conference 2023 and publish to members.
* To update the Standing Orders for the Conduct of the Annual General Meeting (SOCAGM) in accordance with motion LM01 at Autumn Conference 2023 and publish to members
* To update and maintain the Record of Organisational Statements (RoOS).

In relation to outstanding statements not yet notified to Conference as dealt with or incorporated into party documents

* To insert three clauses passed in D01 Autumn 2018 'Facilitating Incorporation of the GPEW' into the constitution "when the transfer happens".
* To update SOC Standing Orders and/or Handbook to reflect various motions passed at Conferences viz: To ensure that the annual ballots for the Green Party Executive (GPEx) and the Policy Development Committee (PDC) are well publicised and fully engaged with by the membership, To ensure that its appointee to the role of ERO takes their role in overseeing the conduct of the elections seriously and takes an active role in responding to complaints and concerns raised about conduct during elections.
* To ensure with PDC that the Policy Process presentation at <https://members.greenparty.org.uk/node/59> is updated if the member website changes (SOC Report Recommendation, A1 Autumn 2020).
* To carry out a full review of regulations for national elections \[ERO Report, part of SOC Report Autumn 2020].

SOC can report on the first group of these that they have been carried out. In relation to the latter group SOC will insert the new clauses included in the draft constitution when the need arises. It keeps the other three concerns under review, and expects the Internal Elections Working Group to include the regulations for national elections in its review.

Change to SOCC to be proposed by SOC to Conference



At its meeting on the 9th December 2023 SOC agreed to a change to SOCC that it would bring to Conference under the rule given by SOCC M4 asking Conference to agree a change already made to SOCC by SOC. This proposed a new section 5(i) of the policy process. In the event the proposed change was left out of the SOCC report and with the passing of the motion to restore Spring Conference at Autumn Conference 2024 might be considered to be no longer required. However, since the Constitution allows Autumn Conference to decide to not hold a Spring Conference, SOC will bring it to Spring Conference as part of its report.



New section 5(i) of the policy process:



“In the event of the suspension of Spring Conference (for example following a decision of Autumn Conference or in the event of a General Election), then SOC may introduce procedures for the discussion of Draft Voting Papers prior to their presentation to a subsequent Conference.

Such procedures will allow for the discussion and agreement of a Draft Voting Paper in a context to be determined by SOC.



This might include, for example, discussion and agreement at a Spring Policyfest, or at a meeting to discuss a particular DVP promoted by a Policy Working Group and Policy Development Committee.

SOC will establish a Forum on which the text of DVPs, that conform to the requirements of ss.5(a) to 5(c) of 

Appendix A ‘The Policy Process’ of SOCC, shall be published at least six weeks before the scheduled discussion meeting.

* The meeting to discuss the DVP shall be advertised to all Party members and not just to those in the Working Group.
* The meeting may be run in person, on-line, or as a hybrid meeting depending on resources.

The policy document as agreed following the meeting may be approved by PDC, after due consideration of the issues outlined in s.6(a) of Appendix A ‘The Policy Process’ of SOCC, to go forward as a Voting Paper to the next Conference following the timetable established by SOC for that Conference.
