## **Synopsis**

The 2024 Manifesto was developed over many months, with its completion rushed due to the timing of the General Election. The Climate Emergency Policy Working Group is proposing this Motion to realign the Manifesto with existing Policy, the latter having been carefully developed and approved by members at Conference.

## **Motion**

This motion is proposed by the Climate Emergency Policy Working Group (CEPWG). The objective is to realign the Manifesto with existing, approved policy, in line with Standing Orders that require public statements to be in line with Policies for a Sustainable Society. We also seek clarification of some statements in the Manifesto to improve communication of our objectives, and we propose minor updates to address some policy areas where policy has been overtaken by events

**These changes will aid our four new MPs in speaking to our Manifesto and our approved policy base with confidence, and without fear of being challenged about any contradictions between the Manifesto and our published policy.**

Note that the Manifesto is required to be ratified by Conference. It is unclear at this stage if the Manifesto will be brought to the Autumn 2024 Conference for ratification. If it is not introduced prior to the pre-agenda deadline, the points in the Motion will still stand and the Motion will be altered to ask Conference to require GPRC to alter the Manifesto to incorporate these changes prior to ratification.

The following are changes proposed to the Green Party General Election Manifesto 2024, Long Version with Cover, as posted at *[ greenparty.org.uk/about/our-manifesto/2024-manifesto-downloads/](http://greenparty.org.uk/about/our-manifesto/2024-manifesto-downloads/)* (reference \[1] in the text below)

Some of these changes are required as the Manifesto directly contradicts existing policy statements. Others are required to ensure that the Manifesto realistically meets the requirements of PSS. The latter points are based on the comprehensive Energy Policy Model (EPM) developed by a sub-group of the CEPWG, *<https://spaces.greenparty.org.uk/s/energy-policy-working-group/>*.

In addition, the Manifesto addresses many of the things that we should do more of to achieve the objectives of the GPEW. However, it omits many of the things that we must do less of at the same time.

**An initial review suggests the following issues should be addressed in the final Motion text. These points to be developed into formal changes prior to the first agenda deadline:**
