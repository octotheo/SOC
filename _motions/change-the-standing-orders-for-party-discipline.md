## Synopsis

This motion amends the party’s disputes and complaints process to make it more transparent, humane, accountable, and in line with our values. These changes were recommended by conference workshops, workings groups reviewing different elements, staff familiar with the Disputes and Complaints process, and industry best practice.

## Motion

SOC Note: The part of this motion dealing with the Constitution will require a 2/3 majority to pass.

Note also, if this motion is passed then motion D05 falls away

**Constitution:**

REPLACE clauses 4.10, 4.11, 4.12, 4.13, 4.14 with 4.10 as follows:

4.10 Disputes and Complaints within the Green Party will be dealt with in accordance with the Standing Orders for Party Discipline (SOPD) and the subordinate Standing Orders and Procedures of the Disciplinary Committee (SOPDC) where applicable.

There shall be a Disputes and Complaints Referral Group (DCRG), Disciplinary Committee (DC), and Appeals Committee which shall operate according to the Standing Orders for Party Discipline and whose membership shall be defined in the same, except for the Appeals committee whose membership shall be defined in the standing orders of the Regional Council.

**Note:** at present –

* Clause 4.10 defines Disciplinary Committee,
* Clause 4.11 concerns the grounds of a complaint,
* Clause 4.12 defines the Disputes and Complaints Referral Group,
* Clause 4.13 concerns the grounds for appeal,
* Clause 4.14 sets out that there shall be Standing Orders for Party Discipline.

RENUMBER existing clause 4.15 as 4.11

```

**Transition:**

Upon passage of this motion, all existing members of the Disciplinary committee shall remain in post until the next annual ballot. At the first annual ballot after the passage of this motion, 20 members will be elected such that 10 are elected to an ordinary 2 year term, and another 10 are elected to a shortened 1 year term such that the terms become staggered as set out in SOPD 1.1.1 (see below).

Following the passage of this motion, the Disciplinary Committee shall be responsible for creating an initial version of the Standing Orders and Procedures of the Disciplinary Committee (SOPDC), which it may agree by consensus or otherwise by simple majority.

Similarly following the passage of this motion, any and all existing complaints in the system shall be resumed and handled using the updated Standing Orders for Party Discipline from the next stage onwards, so as not to disadvantage any participant. Any complaints which are on hold shall be re-considered by DCRG. Cases currently under investigation (or that were not investigated per then-clause 4.2) shall require a charging document to be produced, per SOPD 5.5.

**Standing Orders for Party Discipline:**

REPLACE the *Standing Orders for Party Discipline* with the following (see next page), which is based on:

* The NFSWG (No Fault Suspension Working Group) proposals, including consultation with the membership, and
* Work by the DCWG (Disputes and Complaints Working Group), which includes GPRC and DC

Edit 3.2 Insert the words “or appeal and the relevant committee” at the end of the first bullet point. Insert new second bullet point saying “Be a liaison with the respondent”. Insert “/appellant” after the word “complainant” to the second (would become third) bullet point. Insert “/appellant” after the word “complainant” and “/appeal” after the word “complaint” on the third bullet point (would become fourth bullet point).\

```


<div class="amendment amendment-tbd">
<div class="d-flex justify-content-between align-items-start">
<h3 id="amendment-4">Amendment #4</h3>
</div>
    
AMEND the existing clause 4.7 of the constitution, which currently states:

vii) No member of the Party may be a candidate for any other party in an election for any level of government and no member of another party may be a candidate for The Green Party in any such election except in cases of joint candidacies. No member of the Party may stand as an independent candidate against properly selected Green Party candidate(s). No member may campaign for any candidate standing against a properly selected Green Party candidate.

**Add**: "A complaint may be brought against any member thought to be in contravention of these rules, which will be dealt with according to 4 (x)", such that the new clause 4.7 will read:

vii) No member of the Party may be a candidate for any other party in an election for any level of government and no member of another party may be a candidate for The Green Party in any such election except in cases of joint candidacies. No member of the Party may stand as an independent candidate against properly selected Green Party candidate(s). No member may campaign for any candidate standing against a properly selected Green Party candidate. A complaint may be brought against any member thought to be in contravention of these rules, which will be dealt with according to 4 (x).

AMEND clause 3.2 of the proposed SOPD:

3.2 The Complaints Manager or another delegated member of staff should:\

* Be a liaison with the person submitting a complaint.\
* Offer to speak with the complainant to discuss and assist with finalising their complaint so that it may be properly submitted.\
* Be responsible for notifying a complainant once their complaint has been properly submitted and received.\
* Support participants with any reasonable adjustments, including asking for any times where they will be unable to participate in a hearing, if they know this in advance.

**Add** an additional point " - liaise with the local party Executive to establish whether mediation or local resolution may be possible, or Regional Executive if no local party is present". This would then form an amended 3.2 of the SOPD:

3.2 The Complaints Manager or another delegated member of staff should:\

* Be a liaison with the person submitting a complaint.\
* Offer to speak with the complainant to discuss and assist with finalising their complaint so that it may be properly submitted.\
* Be responsible for notifying a complainant once their complaint has been properly submitted and received.\
* Support participants with any reasonable adjustments, including asking for any times where they will be unable to participate in a hearing, if they know this in advance.\
* Liaise with the local party Executive to establish whether mediation or local resolution may be possible, or Regional Executive if no local party is present
  
</div>          
            

```
      
        
```

3.3 Members will *not* be required to indicate which specific rules have been broken, though the form will provide an opportunity for them to do so, should they feel comfortable doing so. When a member has indicated which rules they believe have been broken, this shall only be to advise the assigned Investigators, not to bind them.

3.4 Members who submit complaints are encouraged to provide as much detail and evidence as they are reasonably able to.

3.5 The Regional Council shall produce a complaint form (including accessible versions as required) and the party shall make the complaint form(s) available on the members website.

3.6 The complaint form(s) shall ask if the member considers the conduct a breach of: the constitution, the code of conduct, or an earlier sanction or temporary suspension (though this is optional per 3.3).

3.7 If one or more (or all) parties to a complaint leaves the party, complaints to which they are a party will continue to be processed, and they shall continue to be invited to participate.

*The following sections outline the rest of the disputes and complaints process.*

**4 Referrals**

4.1 When the party has received a complaint, DCRG shall be responsible for determining (ideally within two calendar weeks) whether:

4.1.1 To dismiss the complaint or refer the complaint onwards, and if so where.

4.1.2 A complaint meets the UPVAM criteria, and if this affects their referral decision.

<p class="alert d-inline-block alert-primary"><strong>SOC Note: </strong> The acronym ‘UPVAM’ as used here and in motion D14 stands for ‘Unreasonable, Persistent, Vexatious, Abusive or Malicious’.</p>

4.1.3 Any requested anonymity will be granted (and if so on what grounds).

4.1.4 To request temporary suspension of one or more of the respondent(s) pending investigation (SPI), which shall then be considered by GPRC in accordance with their standing orders.

4.2 DCRG may refer a complaint to party bodies recognised by the Regional Council for this purpose, including but not limited to: Regional parties (where a Regional disputes process is in place), Disciplinary Committee, Alternative Dispute Resolution Committee, the Spokesperson Support and Monitoring Group, or the Regional Council itself.

4.3 DCRG shall keep a record of its referral decisions using a standardised form.

4.4 The Complaints Manager will inform any respondents who have been named in a complaint, and the complaint will be provided to them with any redactions deemed appropriate by DCRG.

4.5 The Complaints Manager should collect diversity information from the respondent to assist the party in avoiding institutional bias against protected characteristics, and this information shall be aggregated and anonymised before being shared with the EDI officer and EDI committee.

</div>
    
Insert a paragraph 4.6\
The respondent shall be asked to review the complaint and be offered the opportunity to correct their action(s) and/or recognise that their behaviour was inappropriate, and then apologise to the complainant(s) and any other relevant parties to the complaint.\
Their correspondence will be sent to the body to which the complaint has been referred which will consider if this is sufficient to remedy the complaint and, if so, will close the complaint.
  
</div>          
            

```
      
        
```

**5 Investigations**

5.1 The Chair of DC in consultation with others as set out in SOPDC shall consider each complaint referred to DC and determine whether it shall be joined with an existing case or become a new case. A case may contain one or more related complaint.

5.2 They shall appoint at least two Investigators from the Investigator pool to each case.

5.3 The Investigator (s) assigned to a case shall ordinarily be empowered to investigate a case, or otherwise will facilitate an investigation that is conducted by another third party approved by the Green Party Executive.

5.4 Investigators must ensure that respondents are given an opportunity to respond in their defence.

5.5 When the assigned Investigators have completed their investigation (or determined that no investigation is required) they shall produce a charging document and inform the Chair of DC. This document may be finalised by simple majority of the assigned Investigators, or by the Chair of DC in the case of a tie.

5.5.1 The charging document shall indicate which conduct is alleged, the associated evidence; and which clauses of the code of conduct, party’s constitution, and/or sanction or temporary suspension have been breached. This may be include information provided in the original complaint form(s) or rely on the other findings of the investigation.

5.5.2 The Chair of DC shall refer the completed charging document to DCRG, which shall consider whether the case as a whole merits requesting that the Regional Council consider imposing a temporary suspension (pending a final disciplinary outcome). DCRG may also choose to dismiss the case in its entirety where appropriate.\
\
The Investigators may also, with the consent of the Chair of DC, request temporary suspension prior to the completion of the charging document should this be felt to be necessary.

5.5.3 The Complaints Manager will inform the respondent(s) who have been named in the charging document that the party is to bring a disciplinary case against them, and the charging document will be provided to them with any redactions deemed appropriate by DCRG.

**6 Hearings**

6.1 A hearing will be held where a panel of three members of DC shall act as judges, and the assigned Investigators shall present the case on behalf of the Green Party.

6.1.1 No person shall be an Investigator and judge in the same case.

6.2 Hearings will be held at the next practicable date where respondent(s) have been provided at least two calendar weeks notice.

6.2.1 Religious holidays, life events and major commitments, or other culturally important celebrations observed by the respondent or other participant should be avoided, provided the party is informed of such a conflict within one week.

6.3 Respondent(s) shall be given an opportunity to provide a defence during the hearing.

6.4 Respondent(s) may have the support of a McKenzie Friend should that seem desirable to them. They shall be able to support and advise the respondent but may not address the hearing directly.

6.4.1 A McKenzie Friend must either be a member of the party or have otherwise agreed to follow the party’s code of conduct during their participation in the disciplinary process. Any such person who breaches the code of conduct during a hearing may be removed by majority decision of the assigned panel members.

6.5 Disciplinary cases are between The Green Party and one or more named respondents, not disputes between individuals. Complainants may be invited to speak or provide evidence in the hearing, but are not expected to present the case as a whole.

6.6 Observers are not permitted at hearings to ensure the privacy and dignity of the respondents and any witnesses or other participants.

**7 Decisions**

7.1 The assigned panel members will convene to decide the outcome of the case. They shall provide their decision in writing to the Complaints Manager, ideally within three calendar weeks. Where this is not practicable, they shall advise participants (via the complaints manager) when they may receive a final decision.

7.2 The assigned panel members shall have access to relevant precedent and to any past cases concerning the respondent(s) and/or complainant(s), and may consider these factors when issuing a decision.

7.3 The panel members shall issue a decision, which may include one or more sanctions which the party shall impose on the respondent(s).


<div class="amendment amendment-tbd">
<div class="d-flex justify-content-between align-items-start">
<h3 id="amendment-6">Amendment #6</h3>
</div>
    
Add to paragraph 7.3

The sanctions or disciplinary measures available to the Committee are as follows:

\-          censure

\-          required to do training in the subject

\-          required to apologise

\-          exclusion from all party activities for a fixed period

\-          expulsion

\-          excluding the respondent from participation in any specified meeting/meetings or activity of GPEW for a fixed period; (the scope of the exclusion may have national, regional or local reach;)

\-          imposition of conditions on the respondent's participation in GPEW for a fixed period, for example an instruction not to approach a specified complainant in meetings (if appropriate, a set of conditions may be set out in a formal agreement);

\-          removing the respondent from any elected position in GPEW;

\-          disqualification of the respondent from election or co-option to any office in GPEW, for a fixed period;

\-          deselection of the respondent from any candidacy for public office;

\-          disqualification of the respondent from seeking GPEW nomination for election to any public office, for a fixed period;

\-          withdrawal of Green Party designation from a respondent who holds public office (e.g. a councillor), for a fixed period.

\[the above list copied from the current version of SOPD]\
\
The Committee may, at its discretion, impose a sanction which is suspended from immediate effect, to expire after a fixed period. In the event of any further complaint against the respondent being received within that period and subsequently upheld, the Committee may impose the suspended sanction in addition to any sanction awarded for the further complaint.

In circumstances where the Committee does not consider it would be fair to impose any disciplinary measure it may discharge the upheld complaint with no sanction.\
\
If appropriate the Committee will offer additional advice and/or guidance as to future behaviour.
  
</div>          
            

```
      
        
```

7.4 Decisions of the assigned panel members shall be made by a simple majority.\
Dissent may be recorded by way of a minority report when appropriate, provided this is submitted such that it can be included with the rest of the decision.

**8 Appeals**

8.1 Complainants and Respondents both shall have a right of appeal against one or both of:

8.1.1 The severity of the sanction, when wrongdoing was found, on the basis that it was unreasonable i.e. not in line with the party’s guidance on sanctions.

8.1.2 The finding of innocence or wrongdoing by the Disciplinary Committee, Local, or Regional party, on the basis that the process was procedurally unfair to the appellant.

Procedural unfairness is restricted to procedural grounds i.e. that the process set out in the Standing Orders for Party Discipline was not followed correctly (or there was discrimination with respect to one or more protected characteristics).

Anonymised statistics of the protected characteristics of respondents and complainants shall also be included. The Complaints Manager shall provide these statistics to the committee in advance of any report deadlines, and should separately make these available to the EDI officer and EDI committee at least annually where practicable.

The Complaints Manager will no longer be required to report directly to the AGM.

9.2 When a sanction has been imposed, the Complaints Manager shall (within one working day, as a priority) inform all recognised groups of common interest and national party bodies in addition to the relevant regional and local parties and any committees which the sanctioned member belongs to.

9.3 The Complaints Manager shall (within one working day, as a priority) ensure that access to any sensitive systems (including but not limited to) official communication platforms, financial systems, etc. are removed urgently and prior to a respondent being informed of a sanction which would limit access to those systems in order to mitigate misuse where practicable.

9.3.1 The same shall apply where there is a temporary suspension.

9.4 The Complaints Manager shall (within one working day, as a priority) ensure the names of those sanctioned and a record of any active sanctions is made available on the members website or in another suitable place along with a summary of the reasons for each decision to ensure that disciplinary sanctions are transparent and accountable, and that they are adhered to.

9.4.1 The same shall be made available for temporary suspensions.

9.5 There is a general presumption of confidentiality within the disputes and complaints process.

This means that staff or volunteers in positions of responsibility within the process should not discuss these matters in an inappropriate forum, and confidential information should be shared with as few people as practicable.

This confidentiality may be waived in part or in whole by the Regional Council, for example when a respondent has spoken publicly and misrepresented the facts of their case or in response to rumours.

Confidentiality does not prevent respondents, complaints, or other victims or witnesses from speaking out about their experiences.

**10 Guidance and Elaboration:**

**12 Local and Regional Party Complaint Systems**

12.1 Complaints must in the first instance be made to the Green Party’s national Complaints Manager to ensure that the complaint is properly brought, and that there is procedural fairness and an appropriate referral by DCRG.

12.2 Regional parties are expected to have their own process for handling Disputes and Complaints referred to them by the Disputes and Complaints Referral Group.

12.3 Local parties may operate their own disputes and complaints process for handling Disputes and Complaints referred to them by the Disputes and Complaints Referral Group.

12.4 Decisions made under any Local or Regional disputes and complaints process are subject to appeal which shall be considered by the Appeals Committee (see 8.9), and no Local or Regional party may reverse, change, or undermine a decision made at a higher level.

12.5 Sanctions or other decisions issued by a Regional or Local party must be reported to the Complaints Manager so these can be reported alongside any other sanctions (see 9.4).

**13 Temporary Suspensions**

13.1 When imposed by the Regional Council or the designated on-calls committee, a temporary suspension pending investigation (SPI) means that the member concerned must not volunteer for the Green Party or any part of it in any capacity except to participate in any disciplinary cases in which they are a party. They must not participate in Green Party social media spaces.

13.2 Where a temporary suspension has both exceeded 60 days in duration and been ratified by the Regional Council in a decision taken after the elapse of those 60 days, any posts held by the member shall be considered vacant, including any candidacies for external office.

13.3 The basis for imposing a temporary suspension shall be that based on the information available there is either (i) a significant likelihood of continued misconduct which would harm individuals, bodies, or the party as a whole which may be mitigated by imposing a suspension, or (ii) a significant reputational risk for the party.

13.4 Breach of a temporary suspension shall be considered by the panel members in the case when considering sanctions, and may also be justification for the submission of additional complaints or other appropriate action.

When a breach of temporary suspension or other sanction is reported by way of a complaint this may be referred to: 1. Disciplinary Committee and therefore the Investigator(s) and/or 2. GPRC/on-calls to consider whether immediate action is required.

13.5 In the first instance, members placed on temporary suspension will have a 28 day right of reply in which to make representations and/or provide mitigations to the risks identified, after which time the Regional Council’s on-calls committee will review the temporary suspension, taking into account what has been provided.

13.6 From time to time the Regional Council will review any active temporary suspensions, ideally quarterly. When the Regional Council continues a suspension, this is a ratification of the suspension. In advance of a review, members on a temporary suspension shall be offered two calendar weeks to make representations and/or provide mitigations to the risks identified.

13.7 The Regional Council shall keep a record of its temporary suspension decisions using a standardised form.

**A﻿ppendix C: Glossary**\
**Disputes vs Complaints**

A dispute concerns a disagreement or misunderstanding between two parties that may benefit from a third party mediating the situation.

A complaint concerns a breach of the party’s code of conduct or the constitution.

**Anonymity vs Confidentiality**

Anonymity concerns when the identity of one or more persons has been hidden in order to protect them e.g. from retribution.

Confidentiality means that certain matters should be kept secret and not be discussed outside of appropriate forums.

**Recusal vs Conflict of interest**

Recusal means a decision taken by a person to refrain from participating in a discussion, perhaps because of a perceived conflict of interest.

Conflict of interest means a person has a stake in the outcome, for example because they are close friends with one of the parties or because they stand to make money from the outcome.

See GPRC’s Guidance on Recusal.
