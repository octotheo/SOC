## **Synopsis**

Typically, our party publishes manifestos from special interest groups at election time. This year the party chose not to. At previous General Elections processes have been vague. This motion seeks to formalise a process to ensure that, with support, special interest groups are able to write mini-manifestos if they wish.

## **Motion**

Insert a new 14 xi into the Green Party Constitution and renumber

xi) The party shall also publish community and issue specific manifestos at a General Election, developed by our special interest groups. The groups will be supported by the Equality and Diversity Coordinator, and where necessary the Elections Coordinator and the wider Green Party Executive. At the start of the election Green Party Regional Council will be mandated to provide a clear timeline for approval and publication.
