## Synopsis

In the wake of the UK’s withdrawal from membership of the European Union, and consequent upon many recent and less recent developments in the way that European institutions and collaborative organisations are run—including significant changes prompted by the influence of Green Parties across Europe and the urgency of climate action—the GPEW needs to update its policies, across the whole range of topics covered in the Europe chapter. This new voting paper incorporates (with minor revisions) some material passed recently at conferences since Brexit, including a policy statement passed in 2022, and motions passed in Spring and Autumn 2023, but most of the old chapter still remains on the books, including policies that are now forty years out of date.

This voting paper starts from the position we find ourselves in: a UK outside the European Union, but still seeking to cooperate with other countries in Europe across many projects that matter deeply to the Green Party of England and Wales.

The paper covers both relations with the European Union and other issues concerning Europe more generally. It considers a range of mechanisms that the UK can join, whether before or after becoming a member of the EU, and it reflects on how to build a consensus and heal divisions prior to seeking full EU membership. The paper respects the recent votes by the party to favour a position of rejoining the EU as soon as possible, providing that the political will to enable this to happen is clear on both sides, and providing that the situation prevailing in Europe is such that Green Party priorities would be furthered thereby.
