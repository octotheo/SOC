### **Synopsis**

AR428 ends animal exploitation in commercial racing. As amended, AR428 explicitly bans the greyhound-racing industry (over 3–5 years) to prevent injuries, deaths and wastage of dogs. Many groups, RSPCA, Dogs Trust and Blue Cross now support a ban – and a “ban greyhound racing” bill from a Green MSP is scheduled for the Scottish Parliament.

### [](<>)**Motion**

**AR428 (current policy) reads:** The Green Party will end the exploitation of animals in horse racing, greyhound racing and all situations where animals are commercially raced. There would be an immediate ban on the use of the whip in horse racing and in jumps racing, and on the use of a non-linear track in greyhound racing. A single regulatory authority would be put in place for each sport, tasked with establishing and enforcing strict welfare standards. There would be a requirement for full traceability of all animals involved in racing throughout their lives (using microchip technology where applicable) and full publication of injury and death statistics. These statistics would be used as evidence to close dangerous tracks and ban trainers with poor records. Breeding and import of animals for racing will be tightly regulated and monitored to improve welfare and prevent over-breeding. There would be regulation on the conditions and times of transportation of animals used in sport as well as the housing of all animals. A high level of compulsory levy would be imposed on all betting, to be used solely for welfare improvements. 

**Remove some words/rearrange for sense, put mention of greyhounds in the second paragraph and break the list of tasks into bullet points for clarity so that the amended policy reads:**

**AR428:** The Green Party will end the exploitation of animals in all situations where animals are commercially raced. There will be an immediate ban on the whip in horse racing. A high compulsory levy will be imposed on all betting, to be used solely for welfare improvements. A single regulatory authority will be put in place for each industry, tasked with:

* establishing and enforcing strict welfare standards
* enforcing full traceability of all animals throughout their lives (using microchip technology where applicable)
* full publication of injury and death statistics to be used as evidence to close dangerous tracks and ban trainers with poor records
* tightly regulating and monitoring breeding and import of animals to improve welfare and prevent over-breeding
* regulating conditions and times of transportation of animals as well as animal housing.

A Green Government will ban greyhound racing. This will be carried out gradually, over three to five years, to reduce the probability of shelters being overwhelmed, beginning with a reduction in the import and breeding of racing dogs. The ban will help alleviate the suffering of dogs in the greyhound racing industry and contribute to measures aimed at reducing problem gambling. The Green Party will stop advertising and broadcasting greyhound racing on media platforms within 12 months. A high compulsory levy will be imposed on all greyhound racing betting, to be used solely for greyhound welfare, homing and industry wind-down. The Green Party will aim to support those persons deemed dependent on the industry through a “just transition” approach.
