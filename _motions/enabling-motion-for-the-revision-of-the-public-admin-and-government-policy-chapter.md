## Synopsis

A new policy working group was formed at Summer Policy Fest in June 2024 to revise and update the Public Administration and Government chapter of Policies for a Sustainable Society.

## Motion

Conference instructs the policy working group to revise and update the current Public Administration and Government chapter, in consultation with Policy Development Committee, other policy working groups, special interest groups within the Party, and external stakeholders, bringing a draft voting paper to Conference no later than autumn 2026.

In line with the groupâ€™s wish to refocus the priorities within this chapter, it has decided to rename itself the Democracy, Government and Constitution policy working group. Conference agrees that this would be a more appropriate title for the revised and updated policy chapter.
