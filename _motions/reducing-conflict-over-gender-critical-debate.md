## Synopsis

The motion aims to clarify that expression of gender critical views - provided that expression is reasonable or “non objectionable” - is permitted in the Green Party. And it seeks to find common ground, avoiding or reducing conflict.

## Motion

Conference considers that the expression of gender critical views should not be a reason to exclude or to take disciplinary action against any member, provided the manner of that expression is not “objectionable”. Conference instructs Party governance bodies, including GPRC, Disciplinary Committee, and the Green Party Executive (GPEx) to be guided by that view.

In deciding what is and is not an “objectionable” expression of gender critical views, Party governance bodies should have regard to case law, including Ms A Bailey v Stonewall Equality Ltd and others: 2202172/2020, and Maya Forstater v CGD Europe and Others: UKEAT/0105/20/JOJ

Conference requests GPEx to review available legal advice on reasonable expression of gender critical views in a political party and to obtain new, independent and publishable legal advice on the compatibility of the current “Guidance to Identify Queerphobia” with the Equality Act 2010 and the European Convention on Human Rights, Article 10.

Conference instructs GPRC to invite representations from all members and to consult all Special Interest Groups in the Party in order to find common ground on how gender critical views may be expressed in a way which minimises hurt or discomfort to trans people - for example avoidance of mis-gendering or dead-naming.
