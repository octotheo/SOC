Over the past year we have continued to ensure that Greens for Animal Protection (GAP) has taken an active role in various aspects within the Green party. We have regularly ended meetings of PolCom and the Equality and Diversity Committee.

We continue to maintain close ties with the Animal Rights Policy Working Group (ARPWG) and actively supported the drawing, presenta on and ul mate adoption – at this year’s autumn conference – of the motion to end greyhound racing.

Our membership stands at 529 members on Ac on Network, having grown from 329 members since last year. Our members discuss issues of interest via the Loomio platform and on Green Spaces, as well as during members’ meetings.

We have been able to continue to have a stall at conference staffed by our members and furnished with leaflets and information. In particular this year we had a great deal of interest in our self produced leaflet, Stop the Badger Cull NOW! Twenty-four new GAP members were signed up at the stall.

At our 2024 AGM, held at autumn conference with an op on for members to join online, we elected a new committee and discussed future activities. This month, together with the ARPWG, we are holding an online meeting with an invited external speaker, Dr. Pandora Pound, who is an expert in replacement of animals used in research and testing.

It is appreciated that conference now caters for people who eat a plant-based diet exclusively and hope we can look forward to a time when animal-based products are eschewed by all, if not solely for a reduction in the pain and suffering caused to creatures, then perhaps in solidarity with the struggle against climate change.
