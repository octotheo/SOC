## Synopsis

The current International Chapter in Policies for a Sustainable Society received its last major update in March 2006, and its last recorded update was in 2019. A rewrite is required to reflect substantial changes to the international environment since then, not least to reflect developments such as the Paris Agreement,

## Motion

This Conference instructs the Policy Development Committee to initiate a policy development process to rewrite and update the International Chapter of the Policies for a Sustainable Society with a view to bringing a Draft Voting Paper and Voting Paper to future conferences that aim to amend current policies that impact on international development and relations.

The process will be undertaken by the International Development Policy Working Group who will refer to the core values and philosophical basis of GPEW and seek the opinions and involvement of members of the Party with interest or expertise in this area and other related fields.

Liaison and reference will be made to other relevant GPEW policy working groups where appropriate, such as the Peace, Security and Defence PWG and the Europe PWG, which are already represented on IDPWG.

Views of other relevant organisations and professionals will also be sought and referenced in the background paper brought back to Conference.

This Enabling Motion will be valid for two years from the date on which Conference approves it, time for IDPWG to undertake this work, after which time extension of the work will require further approval.
