The Green Party calls on the Chancellor Rachel Reeves to abandon plans to scrap the universal winter fuel allowance after Age UK is calling on 3rd September on the Government to pause their means-testing decision until it can be properly considered as part of the Spending Review next Spring, because as things stand we are hurtling towards a situation in which up to two million pensioners will lose their Winter Fuel Payment imminently when they simply can't afford it.

The Green Party support the principle of universal benefits and are clear that many of the 10 million people who will lose their automatic right to this allowance are likely to suffer distress, increased poverty and impacts on their health. Conference instructs our MPs to do everything they can to pressure the Chancellor to reverse this reckless and unjust decision.
