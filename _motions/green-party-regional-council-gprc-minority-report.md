A minority of the Regional Council find the use of *“misinformation”* in Section 2 to be ill-advised, and the criticism of *“the failure of the Executive”* in this contextto be both misplaced and unhelpful, within the week following a constructive joint GPRC and GPEx meeting in Islington, which promised a step forward in constructive co-operation between the Party’s two senior Governance bodies. The Green Party Regional Council must set the best possible example for the general well-being of our Party.



We acknowledge that the Standing Orders for Party Discipline (Autumn 2021 version 1.1) decrees…

*It is expected that all members of GPEW are **aware of the Constitution**, that they are expected to abide by the Code of Conduct and that their behaviour can reflect on the reputation of the Party*



However, we also acknowledge that the vast majority of Members’ experience of Green Party campaigning will always be local, and that Party Members generally have very limited understanding of how our Party’s local, regional and national governance bodies, as defined in their respective Constitutions, plus related procedures, interact. This is analogous to all of our campaigning experiences of potential voter complaining about *“The Council”*, when they may have little idea whether their Parish / Town / City, District / Borough, or County Unitary Council is responsible for the allotments, pavements or potholes at the heart of their concerns.



We *do* regret that Members who have been subject to a Disciplinary sanction may choose to mis-represent the reason for their sanctions, in public or private. This is sadly a fact of life, because denial is the first stage of grief, and Green Party Membership is deeply important to many of our Members’ identities.



GPRC Representatives are available to their Regional Parties to improve understanding of how the Green Party’s Disciplinary procedures function, including the roles of different governance bodies and GPEW Staff in these procedures. We would welcome invitations to facilitate discussions with our Regional Committees, and at Regional General Meeting / Conferences.
